# Bug Robot
This repo showcases the bug robot my team and I developed during my freshman year of college (2017). The robot was built with the LEGO Mindstorms kit and programmed with LabVIEW. The purpose of this project was to create a robot that performed bug-like functions such as detecting danger, hiding, and eating.

## Functions
 * "Hides" from danger via ultrasonic sensor
 * Detects edges and food using color sensor
 * After eating 5 times, stop eating
 * Navigating terrain without falling off edges
